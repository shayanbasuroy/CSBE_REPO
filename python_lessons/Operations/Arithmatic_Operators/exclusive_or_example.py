caret operator
a ^ b

The ^ operator is called the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It operates on the binary (bit) representation of numbers. Here's how it works:

It compares each bit of the two numbers.
If the bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), the result is 0.
If the bits are different (one is 0 and the other is 1), the result is 1.

Simple Example
Let's take two numbers, a and b, and see how the bitwise XOR operation works.

a = 6 (which is 0110 in binary)
b = 3 (which is 0011 in binary)
When we perform a ^ b, we compare the bits of a and b:"""
